/** MPC106 (Grackle) definitions.

    Grackle IC is a combined memory and PCI controller manufactured by Motorola.
    It's the central device in the Gossamer architecture.
    Manual: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/MPC106UM.pdf

    This code emulates as much functionality as needed to run Power Mac Beige G3.
    This implies that
    - we only support address map B
    - our virtual device reports revision 4.0 as expected by machine firmware
