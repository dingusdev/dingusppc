The PowerPC is the main processor used for Power Macs. Currently, DingusPPC only implements the 32-bit variant.

# General Notes

All instructions are 32 bits wide, regardless of whether the PowerPC is in 32-bit or 64-bit mode.

# BATs

The 601 BATs are emulated by the Open Firmware.

# TLBs

Up to 128 instruction entries and 128 data entries can be stored at a time.

# Exceptions

nnn is either 0x000 or 0xFFF, depending on the 25th bit (0x40) set in the MSR. Usually, the 25th bit is set when booting up a system and unset after it is set.

# Endianness 

PowerPC supports both big-endian and little-endian modes. Mac OS largely operates in big-endian mode, due to its 68k heritage.

# Eccentricities

* The HW Init routine used in the ROMs uses the DEC (decrement; SPR 22) register to measure CPU speed. With a PowerPC 601, the DEC register operates on the same frequency as RTC - 7.8125 MHz but uses only 25 most significant bits. In other words, it decrements by 128 at 1/7.8125 MHz.

* Apple's memcpy routine uses double floating-point registers rather than general purpose registers to load and store 2 32-bit values at once. As the PowerPC usually operates on at least a 64-bit bus and floating-point processing comes with the processors by default, this saves some instructions and results in slightly faster speeds.

* As the PowerPC does not have an instruction to load an immediate 32-bit value, it's common to see a lis/ori coding pattern.

* The 603 relies on the instructions tlbld and tlbli to assist in TLB reloading.

* To accommodate for early programs compiled on PowerPC 601 Macs, the classic Mac OS has to emulate the POWER instructions that were removed from later processors.

* BeOS uses the exception handler by deliberating invoking a supervisor-level instruction while the PR bit is set in the MSR.

* Mac OS X touches the FP bit in the MSR to performing floating-point operations.
