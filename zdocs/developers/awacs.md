AWACS is an audio controller present on several Old World Macs and can usually be located at IOBase (ex.: 0xF3000000 for Power Mac G3 Beige) + 0x14000.

New World Macs have a Screamer chip, which is backwards compatible with the AWACS chip, but with some additional capabilities.

Separate volume controls exist for the CD drive and the microphone.

The DMA buffer size is set to be 0x40000 bytes, while the DMA hardware buffer size is set to be 0x2000 bytes.
